                        Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore
                        strange
                        new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Many say
                        exploration
                        is part of our destiny, but itâ€™s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of
                        the
                        human species.
