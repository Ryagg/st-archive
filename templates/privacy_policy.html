                <p class="mb-1">When you call up a page, your browser loads the required fonts into its browser cache to
                    display texts, fonts, and
                    symbols correctly. For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to the servers of Font
                    Awesome. This allows
                    Font Awesome to know that your IP address has been used to access this website. The use of Font
                    Awesome is based on
                    Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in the uniform presentation of the typeface on our
                    website. If
                    consent has been requested (e.g., consent to the storage of cookies), processing will be carried out
                    exclusively on
                    the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; consent may be revoked at any time.</p>
                <p class="mb-1">If your browser does not support Font Awesome, a standard font from your computer will
                    be used.</p>
