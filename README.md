#### Typography

To match the site's theme, the following fonts were used:

For headings the Millennium font, which is used on the hull of Starfleet vessels in the Star Trek movies and TV series, is used. A webfonts licence for 250000 pageviews was purchased at [fontshop.com](https://www.fontshop.com/).

For all other text the Okuda font, which is based on the computer lettering (the LCARS system) created by Mike Okuda for Star Trek: The Next Generation, is used. A licence for personal, non-commercial purposes without limitations to the amount of prints, pages, or other medium to be produced using them, was obtained from the author at [pixelsagas.com](https://www.pixelsagas.com/).
