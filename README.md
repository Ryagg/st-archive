### Design

---

#### Colour Scheme

To match the site's theme, the following colour scheme was created:
![Colour palette](images/readme/colour-palette.png) It aims to replicate the colours used for LCARS in Star Trek: The Next Generation, which are familiar to every Star Trek fan. Please refer to the Credit section for more info.

#### Typography

To match the site's theme, the following fonts were used:

For headings the Millennium font, which is used on the hull of Starfleet vessels in the Star Trek movies and TV series, is used. A webfonts licence for 250000 pageviews was purchased at [fontshop.com](https://www.fontshop.com/).
![Millennium](images/readme/millenium-20px.png)

For all other text the Okuda font, which is based on the computer lettering (the LCARS system) created by Mike Okuda for Star Trek: The Next Generation, is used. A licence for personal, non-commercial purposes without limitations to the amount of prints, pages, or other medium to be produced using them, was obtained from the author at [pixelsagas.com](https://www.pixelsagas.com/).

#### Imagery

### Wireframes

---

I used Balsamiq to plan the siteâ€™s layout for different viewports (mobile, tablet and desktop). To better demonstrate the differences, I sort my wireframes by page and show the versions for mobile, tablet and desktop next to each other.
All wireframes for this project can be found in the [wireframes sub-directory](https://github.com/Ryagg/st-archive/tree/main/wireframes).

### Database Schema

---

![Database Schema](images/readme/db-scheme.png)
The project uses 4 collections which are stored in MongoDB.

-   The **users** collection stores the username, password and email to enable the user to create an account with a profile page and - as a future feature - to be notified if new books are added to series from his favourites list. Books that have been added to either the favourites list or the whish list, and series that have been added to the favourites list are also stored. Furthermore, information about whether a user is also an admin are stored.

-   The **series** collection stores the name and the code (e.g. 'DIS' for 'Discovery') for each series. It also stores information about whether the series has ended.

-   The **books** collection stores the title, ISBN, blurb and number (within a series) of each book. It also holds the URL for the book cover as well as information about in which format (e-book, paper book and audiobook) the book is available and whether it is part of a mini-series. The 'timespan_start' is the 'stardate' at which the story starts and can be used - as a future feature - to sort books by 'stardate'. The status can be either 'published' or 'announced'.

-   The **reviews** collection stores the ObjectId and username from the user that wrote the review, and the title of the book being reviewed.
